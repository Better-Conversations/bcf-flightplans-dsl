== Flipcharts

#[
// Bold titles.
#show table.cell.where(y: 0): set text(weight: "bold")

#table(
  columns: (auto, auto, 1fr),
  rows: 4,
  align: (x, y) =>
    if y > 0 and x == 2 { left }
    else { center },

== Demo

No demo. 

Alternative example for context:

#list(
  [Imagine you are watching TV and have muted it for the commercials. The first commercial you see shows a kitchen knife setting on a cutting board on the counter. Around it there are lots of different kinds of vegetables and a stock pot. Given that context, you would likely assume they were advertising a cooking show.],
  [The next commercial starts. You see the same kitchen knife. This time it is in the trunk (boot) of car along with some rope, duct tape, a tarp and a shovel.  That context brings up a completely different kind of show! Even though the kitchen knife is exactly the same.]
)
