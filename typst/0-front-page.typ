This is written for the Foundation’s typical delivery team of 2 Facilitators and 1 Producer. If you’re running with a smaller team or just one person you can just ignore the role labels. 

Generally, we create a copy of this for each Better Conversations session we run and keep it for later reference. There’s a section at the end of the document for you to note observations, capture the flip charts and screen shots of the breakout rooms.
